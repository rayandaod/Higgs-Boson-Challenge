###Introduction
This project is the first required project of the EPFL course Machine Learning. Known worldwide, the **Higgs Boson Challenge** in ML is a classifying problem that consists of finding the particle collision events corresponding to Higgs Boson particles. 

Only numpy was allowed.

###Run the project with our best parameters
To run our Machine Learning algorithm with the best parameters we found, please clone this project, download the dataset, put it in a folder called "data" inside the repository, and simply run the run.py file with the following command:

`python run.py`

###Parameters
If you want to tweak the parameters, param.py file will be your best friend since it is basically the control tower of this project.
